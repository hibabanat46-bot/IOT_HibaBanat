# ESP-NOW Wireless Motor Interlock

## Project Description

This project implements a two-way wireless motor interlock system using two ESP32 development boards communicating through ESP-NOW.

Each ESP32 continuously monitors its local IR obstacle sensor and wirelessly controls the DC motor connected to the other ESP32.

No Wi-Fi router or access point is required.

## Hardware

- 2 × ESP32 DevKit
- 2 × IR Obstacle Sensors
- 2 × L298N Motor Drivers
- 2 × DC Motors
- Jumper Wires
- External Power Supply

---

## Communication

ESP-NOW Peer-to-Peer

Each ESP32 works as both:

- Sender
- Receiver

---

## Message Structure

```cpp
struct_message{
    uint8_t senderID;
    bool runMotor;
    uint32_t timestamp;
};
```

---

## Working Principle

If no obstacle is detected:

- Send RUN command
- Remote motor starts.

If obstacle is detected:

- Send STOP command
- Remote motor stops immediately.

---

## Fail Safe

If no ESP-NOW packet is received for more than 2 seconds, the local motor is automatically stopped.
